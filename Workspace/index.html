                <li class="point"><b>1905</b> - Publishes, at age 26, five groundbreaking papers, making this his "annus mirabilis," or miracle year. One of the papers introduces his special theory of relativity and another E = mc2.</li>
                <li class="point"><b>1910</b> - Son Eduard is born.</li>
                <li class="point"><b>1911</b> - Moves with his family to Prague, where he is given a full professorship at the German University there. Attends the invitation-only Solvay Conference in Brussels, the first world physics conference; he is the youngest physicist there.</li>
                <li class="point"><b>1912</b> - Moves with his family to Zurich, where he becomes a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH.</li>
                <li class="point"><b>1914</b> - Becomes director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin and professor of theoretical physics at the University of Berlin. Maric and the children move there in April, but they return to Zurich after three months. Divorce proceedings begin. In August, World War I begins.</li>
                <li class="point"><b>1915</b> - Completes the general theory of relativity.</li>
                <li class="point"><b>1917</b> - Collapses from exhaustion and falls seriously ill. Nursed back to health by his cousin Elsa Löwenthal. Publishes his first paper on cosmology. </li>
                <li class="point"><b>1919</b> - Marries Löwenthal. On May 29, a solar eclipse provides proof of the general theory of relativity.</li>
                <li class="point"><b>1922</b> - Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1921.</li>
                <li class="point"><b>1927</b> - Attends fifth Solvay Conference and begins developing the foundation of quantum mechanics with Niels Bohr.</li>
                <li class="point"><b>1932</b> - As a Jew, begins to feel the heat of Nazi Germany. Now, at 53, at the height of his fame.</li>

                <li class="point"><b>1939</b> - Writes a famous letter to President Franklin Roosevelt not long after the start of World War II that warns of the possibility of Germany's building an atomic bomb and urges nuclear research.</li>
                <li class="point"><b>1940</b> - Becomes an American citizen (retains his Swiss citizenship).</li>
                <li class="point"><b>1955</b> -Dies of heart failure on April 18.</li>
                <li class="point" id="ending">Einstein revolutionised the world of physics and our understanding of the laws of the universe. His theory of relativity is to this day one of the two pillars of modern physics, along with quantum mechanics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.</li>
