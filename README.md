# web-learn

A collection of projects/web pages I have built along the way to my goal of learning html, css and javascript.

## Codecamp

Some of the websites here were built for the freeCodecamp Responsive Web Design course. Some pages are completely unique while others attempt to clone the example given by Codecamp. I did this to save time on coming up with topics to write about etc. so I can just improve my ability to actually build websites from scratch.
